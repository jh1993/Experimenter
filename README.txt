This mod requires AAA_Loader by Bord Listian: https://github.com/DaedalusGame/AAA_Loader
Visit the above link and install it the same way you install this mod, except that you rename the "AAA_Loader-master" folder to "AAA_Loader" before putting it into the mods folder.

This mod may be partially incompatible with API_Universal until I make my own fork of it to work out the incompatibilities, which may be an annoying and tedious task so it may take a while. Until then, use API_Universal at your own risk.

This mod adds several new options to the options menu, which take effect whenever you start a new run. They are meant to allow you to experiment with certain spell and shrine combinations without having to struggle with the hardest parts of very early game. You will be able to, for instance, make the very questionable decision of starting with a level 7 spell and no cantrips, and similar shenanigans.

Changing the new options in the middle of a run has no effect on your current run, but will affect your next run as normal. They can be freely combined with any archmage trial.

The options are detailed below.

Starting Circle: A circle of the chosen tag will be placed on the same tile as your character when you start the run.

Starting Shrine: A special buff will be applied to your character when you start the run, containing the chosen shrine. The first spell you gain that is eligible for that shrine will have the shrine applied to it.

Lucky Start: You start with a Dragon Horn and 1 additional SP per SP orb on realm 1. This simulates the possibility that you're lucky enough to find a Dragon Horn and a Draught of Memories on realm 2, and were able to grab all SP orbs on the level within the duration without needing to use your starting Teleporter.

Easy Start: You start with all SP on realm 1 already collected, and all enemies dead.

If you set starting circle and shrine to none, and lucky and easy start to off, your run will be the same as an unmodded run.
